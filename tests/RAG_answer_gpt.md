Response: **Ethical considerations for using Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG)**  

| Ethical issue | What the context says | Source |
|----------------|----------------------|--------|
| **Reliability of the knowledge source** | RAG’s benefit comes from grounding in external data (e.g., Wikipedia), but that source is never fully factual or bias‑free. | [Source: 3495724.3496517copy.pdf, Page: 9] |
| **Hallucination and factual accuracy** | Even with retrieval, RAG can still hallucinate, especially when questions are not answerable from the knowledge source. However, RAG shows fewer hallucinations and more factuality than purely parametric models like BART. | [Source: 3495724.3496517copy.pdf, Page: 9] |
| **Potential misuse for disinformation** | As with other large language models, RAG could be used to produce abusive, fake, or misleading content in news, social media, or other domains. | [Source: 3495724.3496517copy.pdf, Page: 9] |
| **Social engineering attacks** | RAG could generate convincing phishing or spam content, or impersonate other individuals, facilitating social‑engineering attacks. | [Source: 3495724.3496517copy.pdf, Page: 9] |
| **Job automation** | Advanced language models, including RAG, may automate various tasks traditionally performed by humans, raising concerns about employment impacts. | [Source: 3495724.3496517copy.pdf, Page: 9] |
| **Mitigation opportunities** | The same technology can also be deployed defensively—to detect or counter misleading content and automated spam/phishing. | [Source: 3495724.3496517copy.pdf, Page: 9] |
| **Bias amplification** | Because RAG relies on an external knowledge base that contains human biases, it can inadvertently amplify those biases in its outputs. | [Source: 3495724.3496517copy.pdf, Page: 9] |
| **Governance and oversight** | Ensuring responsible use requires additional safeguards beyond those of pure parametric models, such as content filtering, provenance tracking, and adherence to policy guidelines. | [Source: 3495724.3496517copy.pdf, Page: 9] |

**Bottom line**  
While RAG improves factuality and controllability over purely parametric models, it still inherits the limitations of its external knowledge base (bias, incompleteness) and carries the same broader risks associated with large language models: potential for abuse, misinformation, phishing, impersonation, and workforce displacement. Responsible deployment therefore demands careful oversight, risk‑mitigation strategies, and ongoing monitoring of both source data and generated content.
