Response: Task 1 is the “Presentation for a Company‑Internal Product or Process Innovation Competition.”  
In this task you are to imagine yourself as an intern at a company of your choice and take part in that company’s internal competition for new product or process innovations. The deliverable is a one‑page presentation that can be fully textual, fully visual, or a mix of both. In the presentation you must:

1. Briefly introduce the company you’ve chosen and the industry/field in which it operates.  
2. State the specific topic (product idea or process improvement) you are submitting for the competition.  
3. Explain how you used generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools to refine or develop your innovation idea.  

These requirements are specified directly on page 2 of the task PDF, and the overall task outline appears in the document’s table of contents on page 1.

(.venv) victorhristov@Victors-Mac-Studio rag-tutorial-v2 % python query_data.py "what kind of unicorn do i need to present in task 14?"
Response: The provided context does **not** mention any “task 14” nor does it describe a unicorn‐related requirement for any of the outlined tasks. The document only lists the first three tasks (Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3) and contains no reference to a unicorn or a “task 14”. Therefore, based on this context, there is no information available about what kind of unicorn you would need to present in task 14.
